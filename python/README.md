# Description of Python Files 
The python scripts here were used for graphing data from the wheel adhesion detection project

* MVP Scripts
    * graph_decad.py: Graph decreased adhesion data from iPhone
    * graph_weld.py: Graph weld line data from iPhone
    * graph_data.py: Graph baseline characterization data from iPhone
* Concept Phase Scripts
    * get_sensor_data.py (deprecated): View magnetic fields from the three sensors on WAD (wheel adhesion detection) PCB or dump sensor data into .csv file 
    * get_axes_data.py: View magnetic fields from the three sensors on WAD PCB or dump sensor data into .csv file. The difference between this file and get_sensor_data.py is that this one reads each B-field axis separately
